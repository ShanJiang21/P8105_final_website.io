### Analysis

For the purpose of working with job description text stored as strings in R, we removed stop words from the text before we searched for words or phrases occurring at high frequency among the text. Occasionally throughout our navigating progress,  we have to adjust the stop words library in order to keep some case and letter sensitive word, for example, software languages R, C, or C++.
